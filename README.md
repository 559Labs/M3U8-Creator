# M3U8-Creator
Simplifies the process of managing a clean/valid m3u8 file and associated logos &amp; epg. Primarily for use with the  [IPTV Simple Client](http://kodi.wiki/view/Add-on:IPTV_Simple_Client) for [Kodi](http://kodi.tv/), but can be adapted for other clients as well (such as adding an additional capture card for [MythTV](https://www.mythtv.org/)).

## Technology/Software
This app is powered by Django, and the main user interaction is in a web browser. At the moment, it's fairly light in the UI department.

Usage and installation instructions are forthcoming. This is very much alpha software.
